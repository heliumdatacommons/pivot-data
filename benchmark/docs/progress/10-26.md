========

- [x] Create script for parsing `iozone` output
- [ ] Create a playbook for the local disk as the baseline
- [ ] Run single-host, single-client tests against all the filesystems
  - [ ] NFSv4
  - [ ] CephFS
    - CephFS cannot run on a single node (even with multiple OSDs) - it will run into an unhealthy 
      status and get the clients stuck. 
  - [ ] Ceph RBD + NFSv4
    - Similarly with CephFS, Ceph RBD creation will get stuck on a single node even with multiple 
    OSDs.
  - [ ] NFS Ganesha
  - [x] GlusterFS
    - GlusterFS client cannot run on `alpine` image, forcing the switch of the `iozone` image from 
      `alpine:latest` to `ubuntu:bionic` and voiding the results of the previous experiments :(
  - [ ] GlusterFS + NFS Ganesha
