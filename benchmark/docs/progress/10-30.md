- [x] Summarize the observations from the completed experiments
    - NFSv4-based solutions are not good at read-heavy workloads - they are slow in initial reads
      and cannot leverage cache effectively to speed up re-reads. 
    - NFS Ganesha-based solutions aggressively cache data and thus perform outstandingly in 
      read-heavy workloads as compared to the kernel-space counterpart.
    - GlusterFS also caches aggressively and facilitates re-reads, although it is extremely slow in 
      most operations. 
    - CephFS appears mediocre in most tests except reads. However, it worths noting that solutions 
      that outperform CephFS are centralized (w/ variants of NFS) in nature and may not scale in 
      performance as the number of clients increases. In contrast to GlusterFS, CephFS is more 
      stable and faster in most operations.
